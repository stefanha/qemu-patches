This repository contains a Dockerfile for an image that periodically refreshes
a patches.json database from qemu.git and the qemu-devel mailing list.

If you just want to *use* the 'patches' tool for QEMU, you do not need this
code.  Instead you should run:

  $ git clone -b stefanha https://github.com/stefanha/patches.git
  $ cd patches
  $ ./patches fetch http://wiki.qemu-project.org/patches/patches.json
