This repository contains a Fabric script, or 'fabfile', that configures a
machine to periodically refresh a 'patches' database from qemu.git and the
qemu-devel mailing list.

If you just want to *use* the 'patches' tool for QEMU, you do not need this
code.  Instead you should run:

  $ git clone -b stefanha-tweaks git://github.com/stefanha/patches.git
  $ cd patches
  $ ./patches fetch http://vmsplice.net/~patches/patches.json
